**How it works - detailed**

This tool uses advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to find baby names similar to the one you enter. Specifically, it leverages **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **Cosine Similarity** to compute the similarity between names based on their character composition.

- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: This technique converts each name into a set of character-level n-grams (combinations of two or three consecutive characters). It then calculates the importance of each n-gram in distinguishing one name from others, helping capture subtle patterns between names like "Anne" and "Anna."
  
- **Cosine Similarity**: Once the names are transformed into TF-IDF vectors, Cosine Similarity measures how close the vectors are in multidimensional space. Names with higher similarity scores are more linguistically related to the input name.


1. You enter a name, and the system retrieves all names from the database starting with the same letter.
2. Using NLP, it computes the similarity between the input name and potential matches.
3. The system ranks the names by similarity and displays the top results.
4. You can also visualize the results as a word cloud, where the size of each name represents its similarity score.

For example, entering "Anne" might return similar names like "Anna," "Annie," or "Annabelle," ranked by similarity.

**Model Description**

This model uses a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** with an **LSTM layer** to generate baby names based on character sequences. It works by learning patterns in names, predicting the next character from a given input.

- The **Embedding layer** converts characters into dense vectors.
- The **LSTM layer** captures the order and patterns in names.
- The final **Dense layer** with softmax outputs the next character based on probabilities.

The model is trained using 100 epochs to predict the next character in a sequence. You provide seed letters, and the model generates a new name based on its learned patterns.
